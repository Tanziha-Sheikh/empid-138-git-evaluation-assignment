 ## **About Git :-**

Git is a version control system that developers use all over the world. It helps you to track different versions of your code and collaborate with other developers.If you are working on a project over time, you may want to keep track of which changes were made, by whom, and when those changes were made. This becomes increasingly important if you end up having a bug in your code! Git can help you with this.
